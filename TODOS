need:
- tidy up!!!!
- when creating furnishings, should be able to determine size with drag
- wall functionality in general. draw one wall, start drawing the next from where last one finished.
repeat until final wall meets placement of first wall origin
- sizes of objects displayed next to the corresponding object, would need to merge object and its size label into one.
This would allow the object and label to be updated together as needed.

in progress:
- should be able to rotate furnishings. (sorta works, easy fix would be to rotate a set amount of degrees clockwise
or anticlockwise based on left or right clicking the object. Hard fix would be make it work smoothly with left click
and drag, would be useful for creating drag-to-size boxes later.)
- what buttons are needed? (being changed as needed right now...)

Done:
- base workspace
- basic buttons
- adding to canvas at mouse location
- movable objects on canvas
- deleting from canvas at mouse location
