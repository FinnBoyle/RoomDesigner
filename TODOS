need:
- tidy up!!!!
- wall functionality in general. draw one wall, start drawing the next from where last one finished.
repeat until final wall meets placement of first wall origin
- sizes of objects displayed next to the corresponding object, would need to merge object and its size label into one.
This would allow the object and label to be updated together as needed.
- objects need to maintain their qualities as they are rotated (start green but get rotated into black)

in progress:
- what buttons are needed? (being changed as needed right now...)
- drag to alter size (Currently works same as drag to move. Need to keep on corner vertex the same while resizing.)

Done:
- base workspace
- basic buttons
- adding to canvas at mouse location
- movable objects on canvas
- deleting from canvas at mouse location
- rotatable furnishings
